/**
 * Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
 * improve it.
 * Your tasks:
 * 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
 * is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
 * 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
 * BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
 * Hint: Use an if/else statement ï¿½
