/**
 * Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to
 * implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass
 * / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter)
 * Your tasks:
 * 1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and
 * height (Mark Miller and John Smith)
 * 2. Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same
 * method on both objects). Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it
 * from the method
 * 3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the
 * respective BMI. Example: "John's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark's (23.9)!"
 * Test data: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m
 * tall.
 *
 * GOOD LUCK ï¿½@format
